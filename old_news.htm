These programs are: Super Start, KerNO, Insane Game, Dr. Mario, ZTetris, Tron, and Remote Control.</p>
  <p><b>Background:</b></p>
  <p>Super Start is probably the most useful program I've ever made, it makes playing games on any calculator a breeze! With Super Start, you no longer need a <i>"launcher program"</i> to make ppg programs and large ASM programs work on your
    calculator. <br /> <center><img src="images/SuperStart.gif" /> <img src="images/KerNO.gif" /></center> </p>
  <p>If you're new to KerNO, I encourage you to try it out. KerNO speeds up your calculator's keyboard repeat rates, provides anti-crash protection and all in all enhances your calculator. You can use key combinations such as DIAMOND+ON to turn your calcualtor
    OFF in almost any program... even when the calculator is busy (ie in the middle of a long calculation such as "244!") KerNO is <b>NOT</b> a kernel in the <i>traditional</i> sense of the word. In fact, KerNO will not run programs designed specifically for DoorsOS or PreOS. If you have a
    program that requires a kernel, I recommend PreOS.</p>
  <p>Dr. Mario and ZTetris are old school programs. In fact, I ported them to NOSTUB from DoorsOS. These two games are timeless classics. ZTetris can link to any calculator (TI-85, TI-86, TI-83 Plus, etc...) to allow you to play head to head Tetris with all of your friends.<br />
<center><img src="images/tetris.gif" /> <img src="images/drmario.gif" /> <img src="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/ss/240/24021.gif" /></center></p>
  <p>Rounding off the list are Tron, Remote Control and Insane Game. Tron, is well, tron, and Remote Control is mostly useful for making animated screen shots, and / or scaring your friends by controlling their calculator from yours...  And the Insane Game is probabbly the wierdest game you will ever play. I know it doesn't look like much, but the Action Mode and Link Play modes are very addicting! Have fun! :)</p>
<p>This is the first round of updates. In the near future, I hope to update some more of my programs (including Command Post Plus) so that they will work properly on the TI-89 Titanium.</p></td></tr></table></tr></table><br><table width="100%" bgcolor="BLACK" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><table width="100%" border="1" bgcolor="black" BORDERCOLORDARK="BLACK" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="BLACK" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr bgcolor="black" BORDERCOLORDARK="#333333" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#333333"><td background="templates/GForce_Calc/img.png"><b><center><font color="Gold">Pending Updates</font></center></b></td></tr><tr><td BORDERCOLOR="#333333"><b><p><b>08-18-2004</b><br></b><p>I've been hard at work redesigning the code base that runs this website, as well as slightly changing the color scheme.

This App is called Super Start and will be (i hope) very useful to many people.<p>
 Super Start can launch any normal program and exepacked (ppg) programs with a TI-BASIC extension called sstart. ex: sstart("tetris") it also supports passing of values and return values for people who want to take advantage of that. You can think of sstart as an improvement on ttstart which can be found on the <a href="http://tict.ticalc.org">TICT</a> website.<br>  Secondly, this flash App provides the functionality of Auto Start which is a program that i originally wrote to make the process of starting a program from the home screen much less tedious.</p>
<p>
  Finally, Super Start can help programmers debug their code because it allows them to use the leak watch feature of <a href="http://www.detachedsolutions.com/cmdpost/">Command Post</a> to monitor normal ASM and ppg programs for memory leaks.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Super Start can save a lot of RAM and ARCHIVE memory because you do not need individual launchers for each ppg-compressed program. This FLASH app needs 12 bytes of RAM to launch a program compared to the 2009 bytes needed for ttstart to launch a program (a 99.4% difference!). For a full list of features, please follow this link.<p>
<bold>UPDATE</bold><br>While working with Oliver Armand to add support for Super Start in ID, he found out that Super Start could crash when it runs some programs made with an older version of TIGCC that contain a buggy version of tipatch.lib (it did not save/restore a2). This problem can easily be fixed by recompiling those programs with newer versions of TIGCC. Additionally, I have sent an updated version of Super Start to TI for signing. This updated version will be able to work around said problems.</p></td></tr></table></tr></table><br><table width="100%" bgcolor="BLACK" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><table width="100%" border="1" bgcolor="black" BORDERCOLORDARK="BLACK" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="BLACK" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr bgcolor="black" BORDERCOLORDARK="#333333" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#333333"><td background="templates/GForce_Calc/img.png"><b><center><font color="Gold">New Server</font></center></b></td></tr><tr><td BORDERCOLOR="#333333"><b><p><b>05-30-2003</b><br></b>If you can read this article, then welcome back :) GForce Programming has just completed a move to its new server.

The first being KerNO v2.1<br>
This version of KerNO fixes a problem on HW2 Calculators with the AMS 2.08 Clock Feature... this bug prevented the calculator from being turned on with the ON key after using KerNO's DIAMOND+ON feature (removing the batteries, or inserting a link cord was the only way to turn the calc back on).

I also updated to version 1.11 of <a href="http://kevinkofler.cjb.net/" target="_blank">Kevin Kofler's</a> h220xtsr.
<p>
Secondly, I have <b><i>completely</i></b> revised the method that I use to install TSR Event Hooks. As a result, I have re-released SampleTSR, and The Matrix Screen Saver (updates to my other TSR's are on the way).

I highly recommend using the updated version of SampleTSR for creating your own event hooks. It is smaller, simpler, faster, and does not have the pesky "Already Installed" bug that was present in the older version! If you have released event hooks in the past using my SampleTSR template, I also recommend that you attempt to update your programs to the new method (it is a fairly painless procedure).</td></tr></table></tr></table><br><table width="100%" bgcolor="BLACK" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><table width="100%" border="1" bgcolor="black" BORDERCOLORDARK="BLACK" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="BLACK" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr bgcolor="black" BORDERCOLORDARK="#333333" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#333333"><td background="templates/GForce_Calc/img.png"><b><center><font color="Gold">ZTetris 1.52</font></center></b></td></tr><tr><td BORDERCOLOR="#333333"><b><p><b>10-09-2002</b><br></b>Yan Zhang informed me about a small bug in ZTetris 1.51.

Secondly, I replaced Tetris 1.51 to ticalc.org, and called it <i>ZTetris 1.51</i>.

This release corrects several bugs in previous releases which would cause FLASH APPS to crash. It also adds several new (and innovative) features to KerNO’s repertoire.

The biggest change being that the Sto->ON combo is replaced with ESC ON. For developers, there is a special xdef so that KerNO will work around the bug in VTI. Also, note that KerNO is not compatible with Kevin Kofler's h220xtsr, and if KerNO is to be installed on a HW2 calc, HW2 patch must be installed first. For KerNO's key combinations to work with any program, the default ON KEY interrupt must not be disabled (auto-int 6).... a lot of games don't do that, and that is why the esc+on and diamond+on combinations do not work with them.

Sstart is a utility that combines ttstart and start into one simple program. As you can see, I have made some major changes, so have fun and download away ;)<br>
<br>
A word of warning about the SampleTSR example: The support for OPTIMIZE_ROM_CALLS may not work correctly all of the time. You need to check the .s files that tigcc produces to make sure that it is working correctly.</p>
